#Medusa

Basilisk II is an Open Source [68k Macintosh emulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Macintosh_platform_emulators): it allows you to run 68k Mac OS software on your computer in a different operating system. However, you still need a copy of Mac OS and a Macintosh ROM image to use Basilisk II. It was developed by Christian Bauer and improved by a large open-source community. 

However, Basilisk II is a bit messy to setup. This is where *Medusa* comes in:

Medusa is a modern interface that allows the creation of [virtual machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) to be easily manipulated and used by OSX users.

Please refer to [Basilisk's official website](http://basilisk.cebix.net/) for more information on the emulator.

Please refer to [Medusa's changelog page](http://medusa.mariot.me.uk) for download of the compiled versions of all releases and detailed description of each of them.
